To run the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luiza-omena/React-management-tool.git
   cd task-manager

2. Install dependencies:
  npm install

3. Run the development server:
  npm run dev
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5173/
