Note: Before getting started, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. React is built on top of Node.js, so if you don't have it already, you can download it from https://nodejs.org/. Choose the "LTS" (Long-Term Support) version for greater stability.
In addition to this, it's beneficial to have a code editor such as VSCode to work with the code.

To run the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luiza-omena/React-management-tool.git
   cd task-manager

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Run the development server:
   npm run dev
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5173/
